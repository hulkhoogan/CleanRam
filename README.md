Simple Process Killer

Trusting on kernel, he ask for kill all the running app's, kernel decide what can be killed. Works great.

Widget just call app, app just scan all running process's and ask kernel for kill, finishing with a Toaster message.

There is the widget and the app.

Opening app, is the same that open widget. Just made for fun and introduce android world :)
