# CleanRam

Simple Process Killer


The widget only opens the application. 
The application looks for all processes that are running and sends a signal to kill them, if the target is a user application, the app will have the appropriate permissions to kill them, releasing the respective memory and smoothing the system.

Just made for fun and introduce android world :)
